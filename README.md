Follow-up Question Recommendations for Knowledge Inquiry Systems

*Term Project for CSE 583 - Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Class*

QA systems are build to answer questions, but sometimes the users don’t really know what they want to know; providing the right answer is not always feasible and/or enough. 

The objective of this project: by leveraging machine learning techniques, a QA system can help build on the user’s knowledge and provide the user with relevant information even when no good answer is available. 

In a sense, implement a **recommender system for follow-up questions**: suggest new questions to the user that might add to the already acquired knowledge.

Recommender systems are pretty common when there is a user profile available with stored information about user preferences, e.g. movie recommendations. In our case we have **no preference data** –we want to make recommendations by relying entirely on content, meaning the **input question**.
